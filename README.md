# AI Search-Tree Visualizer: Minimax & Alpha-Beta Showcase (MERN)

This is a full-stack web application designed to demonstrate and compare how search algorithms function. By playing Tic Tac Toe, you can observe the real-time performance of **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to visualize adversarial search. It provides a practical look at how an AI evaluates game states and optimizes its decision-making process.

### Minimax Algorithm

- **Exhaustive Search:** The AI explores every possible future move to ensure it plays perfectly.
- **Recursive Evaluation:** It builds a complete game tree and assigns scores to every outcome.
- **Performance:** While highly accurate, it becomes computationally "expensive" as the board size grows because it never skips a branch.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

- **Optimized Search:** This is an enhanced version of Minimax that significantly improves speed.
- **Pruning Logic:** The AI stops evaluating a branch as soon as it determines that the move cannot possibly be better than a previously examined option.
- **Identical Accuracy:** It achieves the same perfect result as Minimax but with much less processing power.

## AI Performance Metrics

This application tracks and displays specific data points to show the efficiency of each algorithm:

- **Nodes Visited:** A live counter showing the total number of board states the AI analyzed. This reveals the computational load of the search.
- **Branches Pruned:** A metric specifically for Alpha-Beta that counts how many potential moves were skipped to save time.
- **Algorithm Visualizer:** A real-time console that logs heuristic scores and decision paths as the AI "thinks."

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database:** Simple JSON storage for score tracking and game history.
- **Logic:** Custom recursive implementations of search algorithms in JavaScript.

## Usage for Analysis

1. Launch the app and navigate to **Single Player**.
2. Select **Minimax** and play; check the **Nodes Visited** in the sidebar.
3. Press the "Show Algorithm Visualization" button to see text based logs.
4. Restart and select **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.
5. Compare the **Nodes Visited** count and observe the **Branches Pruned** metric to see the computational savings in real-time.
